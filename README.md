# 3D-Stress-Element-Visualizer
A tool for visualizing the 3D stress element and its principal stresses

This project was made while I was studying the 2D stress element and I wanted to find an interesting way to visualize it in 3 dimensions.
There are some problems with it rendering the correct angles for specific inputs but I havent yet been able to track down the problem.

This also works for 2D, you just need to input 0 for all values with a "z" in the name.

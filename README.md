# 3D-Stress-Element-Visualizer
A tool for visualizing the 3D stress element and its principal stresses

This project was made while i was studying the 2D stress element and i wanted to find an interesting way to visualize it in 3 dimensions.
It currently has some problems rotating the cube perfectly and im not sure if its due to my math being wrong or the matplotlib.pyplot graphing software
not rendering it correctly/squishing it.

This also works for 2D, you just need to input 0 for all values with a "z" in the name.
